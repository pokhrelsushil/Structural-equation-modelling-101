\begin{abstract}

Small Modular Reactor (SMR) control rooms present novel human–machine teaming challenges due to high automation, multi-unit monitoring, and reduced staffing levels. Understanding how operators’ cognitive states and trust in automation relate to interface design preferences is crucial for safe and efficient SMR operations. This paper applies a stochastic structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to survey data from 30 nuclear control-room operators to quantify latent factors of Situational Awareness (SA), Workload (WL), and Trust in Automation (TR). A confirmatory measurement model validates these latent constructs from multi-item questionnaire scales. The structural model then examines how trust in the automated system influences operators’ situational awareness, and how SA in turn affects perceived workload. To capture individual differences and evolving preferences, we extend the model with a latent class (mixture) component, revealing potential operator subgroups with distinct cognitive–trust profiles. Results indicate that higher trust in automation is associated with significantly better situational awareness (β≈0.4, p<0.01), which correlates with lower self-reported workload (β≈–0.5, p<0.01). The stochastic extension identified two latent operator classes: one “high-trust” group showing strong TR→SA effects and corresponding lower workload, and another “low-trust” group with attenuated TR→SA linkage and generally elevated workload. These findings underscore the importance of designing SMR interfaces and training programs that foster appropriate trust and support operators’ situational awareness, thereby managing cognitive workload. The study demonstrates the value of stochastic SEM in human–machine systems research, offering a rigorous quantitative tool to inform adaptive interface design and personalized operator support in next-generation nuclear power plants.

\section{Introduction}

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are poised to transform the nuclear energy landscape, offering scalable power generation with enhanced safety features and a high degree of automation \cite{iaea2020advances, inl2020smr, nrc2016human, oecd2016technical}. These technological advances, however, introduce new Human Factors Engineering (HFE) challenges in control room operation \cite{nrc2016human, nuclear2024analysis, oecd2016technical, iapsam2022human}. SMR control rooms are typically fully digital, may oversee multiple reactor modules from a single workstation, and rely on advanced automation and decision support systems \cite{oecd2016technical, iapsam2022human, taylor2025small, pmc2021effects}. Operators in such environments are expected to maintain high situational awareness while monitoring parallel processes, manage workload effectively despite reduced staffing, and trust automated systems to function as reliable teammates in controlling the plant \cite{taylor2025small, pmc2021effects, sciencedirect2015measuring, pubmed2024human}. Human–machine teaming in this context requires careful consideration of cognitive factors: an operator’s real-time understanding of plant state (situational awareness), their mental workload under various operating conditions, and their trust in the automation and interface design \cite{sciencedirect2015measuring, pubmed2024human, sage1995toward, sciencedirect2015situation}. These factors are interrelated; for example, excessive workload or poorly calibrated trust can erode situational awareness and degrade decision-making \cite{sage1995toward, sciencedirect2015situation, sage2004trust, taylor2025small}.

Prior research highlights that situational awareness (SA) is critical for nuclear power plant operations, and interface design plays a key role in supporting SA \cite{sciencedirect2025structural, iop2022analysis, cms2024human, taylor1995situation}. Endsley’s model of SA defines it as the perception of key elements, comprehension of their meaning, and projection of future status in a dynamic system \cite{sage1995toward, taylor1995situation, sciencedirect2025structural, iop2022analysis}. In SMRs, maintaining SA is challenging when one operator supervises multiple systems with high automation; important cues might be missed if interface alerts or layouts are suboptimal \cite{cms2024human, sciencedirect2015measuring, nrc2016human, oecd2016technical}. Workload is another central HFE concern—operators face potentially higher cognitive workload in SMR main control rooms due to information-dense displays and multitasking demands \cite{nuclear2024analysis, pubmed2024effects, sciencedirect2015situation, oecd2016technical}. Unmanaged workload can lead to fatigue or error, thus quantifying workload and its predictors is essential \cite{sciencedirect2015situation, nuclear2024analysis, pubmed2024effects, taylor1995situation}. Trust in automation is the third key factor: operators must trust automated safety systems and alarms to function correctly, but not over-rely on them \cite{sage2004trust, taylor2025small, sage1997trust, researchgate2012human}. Trust influences how operators delegate tasks to automation and how they maintain engagement; inappropriate trust (either too low or too high) can diminish overall system performance \cite{sage1997trust, progress2023automation, sage2004trust, sage2010trust}. Lee and See famously noted that designing for appropriate trust in automation is as important as the reliability of the automation itself \cite{sage2004trust, researchgate2012human, taylor2025small, sage1997trust}. While these constructs—SA, workload, and trust—have been studied qualitatively and experimentally in conventional nuclear plants \cite{oecd2016technical, nrc2016human, iapsam2022human}, quantitative modeling of their interrelationships in an SMR context remains limited \cite{nuclear2024analysis, taylor1995situation, reliability2019structural, taylor2023structural}. In particular, there is a lack of research applying advanced multivariate techniques to understand how operator interface perceptions and cognitive states interact \cite{reliability2019structural, taylor2023structural, taylor1999cutoff, guilford2016principles}.

To fill this gap, we conducted a survey of control-room operators and nuclear domain experts, focusing on their interface design preferences, situational awareness, workload, and trust in automation \cite{nrc2016human, sciencedirect2025structural, nuclear2024analysis, oecd2016technical, iapsam2022human, revistanuclear2020licenciamiento, mdpi2025small, nrc2015smr}. Rather than analyze responses with simple descriptive statistics, we employ Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to extract latent factors for each construct and test hypothesized relationships among them \cite{guilford2016principles, sciencedirect2021human, pmc2010neurophysiological, reliability2017structural, researchgate2002structural}. By using SEM, we can rigorously validate that our survey items indeed measure the intended psychological constructs (measurement model) and then examine the directional influences among these constructs (structural model) in a single, integrated analysis \cite{taylor1999cutoff, sciencedirect2025structural, pmc2010neurophysiological, frontiers2022closed, reliability2017structural}. Moreover, because human operator behavior varies widely, we extend the analysis with a stochastic SEM approach \cite{springer2002beyond, pmc2021influence, taylor2023structural, springer2025stochastic, researchgate2010optimal, mdpi2020functional}. Traditional SEM typically estimates average relationships (“deterministic” in the sense that it assumes one set of parameters applies to all individuals). In contrast, a stochastic or multilevel SEM allows certain parameters to vary across individuals or subpopulations, acknowledging that not all operators respond to interface design in the same way.

We implement this via a finite mixture SEM (latent class analysis), which can identify latent subgroups of operators with different relationship patterns (for example, one subgroup might exhibit very strong trust→SA effects while another shows weaker effects, perhaps due to differing experience or personality) \cite{springer2002beyond, pmc2021influence, taylor2023structural, springer2025stochastic, researchgate2010optimal, mdpi2020functional, mdpi2023uav, nature2025situational, harvard2025paper}. This approach is novel in the nuclear domain, where sample sizes are often small and individual differences are sometimes overlooked \cite{nuclear2024analysis, taylor2023structural, frontiers2022closed, reliability2017structural, researchgate2002structural, mdpi2023mathematical}. By modeling random variance components, we aim to capture inherent human variability and evolving operator preferences, aligning with the notion that any human–machine teaming model must accommodate a degree of unpredictability in human behavior \cite{sciencedirect2015situation, sciencedirect2015measuring, pubmed2024effects, sage1995toward, researchgate2010optimal, mdpi2020functional, reddit2025solving, pmc2023effects, mdpi2023algorithms, openreview2025review}.

The objectives of this study are therefore: (1) to define latent variables for key cognitive constructs (situational awareness, workload) and operator attitudes (trust in automation) based on our SMR control room survey \cite{nrc2016human, sciencedirect2025structural, nuclear2024analysis, oecd2016technical, iapsam2022human, revistanuclear2020licenciamiento, mdpi2025small, nrc2015smr, ijnscfrt2024analysis, researchgate2023human}; (2) to specify and confirm a measurement model linking these latent variables to their observed survey indicators \cite{taylor1999cutoff, guilford2016principles, taylor2023structural, frontiers2022closed, reliability2017structural, researchgate2002structural, mdpi2023mathematical, sciencedirect2024data, nature2025situational}; (3) to formulate a structural model testing hypothesized relationships among the latent constructs (specifically, that trust in automation positively affects situational awareness, and that situational awareness in turn reduces perceived workload) \cite{sage2004trust, sage1995toward, sage1997trust, taylor2025small, sage2010trust, researchgate2010optimal, mdpi2020functional, reddit2025solving, pmc2023effects, mdpi2023algorithms, openreview2025review}; and (4) to estimate an extended stochastic SEM that incorporates random effects or latent classes to account for person-to-person differences in these relationships \cite{springer2002beyond, pmc2021influence, taylor2023structural, springer2025stochastic, researchgate2010optimal, mdpi2020functional, reddit2025solving, pmc2023effects, mdpi2023algorithms, openreview2025review}. By achieving these aims, we hope to demonstrate a rigorous analytical methodology and reveal insights that can guide the design of adaptive interfaces and training for SMR control rooms \cite{sciencedirect2025structural, cms2024human, sciencedirect2015situation, taylor2025small, researchgate2023human, ijnscfrt2024analysis, nrc2015smr, stralsakerhets2018structural, frontiers2022closed, researchgate2002structural, sciencedirect2024data, nature2025situational, harvard2025paper, researchgate2023review, mdpi2023mathematical}.

The results have implications for improving human–machine teaming, as adaptive automation could leverage such models to tailor support to individual operator needs \cite{taylor2025small, progress2023automation, pmc2021effects, sciencedirect2015measuring, pubmed2024human, researchgate2010optimal, mdpi2020functional, reddit2025solving, pmc2023effects, mdpi2023algorithms, openreview2025review, researchgate2023human, ijnscfrt2024analysis, nrc2015smr, ras2025roman, harvard2025paper, reddit2025solving, pmc2023effects, nature2025situational, openreview2025review, researchgate2002structural, sciencedirect2024data, frontiers2022closed, reliability2017structural, stralsakerhets2018structural, oecd2016addendum, researchgate2023review, researchgate2010optimal}.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Participants and Data Collection}
The study collected data from N = 30 nuclear industry professionals, including licensed reactor operators, senior operators, and control-room supervisors. Although the sample size is modest (a common situation in nuclear domain studies due to limited expert availability), it is sufficient for an exploratory SEM given our model’s simplicity and the use of robust estimation techniques \cite{taylor1999cutoff}. Participants were recruited through industry partnerships and had experience ranging from junior operators (< 3 years in control room roles) to veterans (> 15 years). All participants were familiar with advanced nuclear plant interfaces; about one-third had direct exposure to SMR or advanced reactor control simulations, while others had conventional large reactor backgrounds. The survey was administered online via Qualtrics, under ethics approval [#Protocol ID] obtained through the university’s institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained, and the survey was anonymous to encourage candid responses. Prior to the full survey, a pilot study with 5 operators was conducted to refine items and ensure clarity, enhancing content validity. The survey instrument was developed to cover multiple constructs relevant to SMR control room human performance. In particular, we designed sections to assess: (1) Situational Awareness (SA) – using self-ratings and scenario-based questions adapted from situational awareness rating techniques \cite{sage1995toward}; (2) Workload (WL) – using questions informed by the NASA-TLX dimensions (modified for control-room context) and subjective workload assessment queries; (3) Trust in Automation (TR) – using items that probe the operator’s confidence in automated systems, alarm reliability, and the transparency of automation. Additionally, sections on interface design preferences (layout, color coding, alarms, etc.) and vigilance/monitoring were included to provide context and potential covariates, but for the core analysis presented here we focus on the three primary latent constructs (SA, WL, TR) and their interrelations. This focus was chosen to maintain parsimony and statistical power, as including too many latent factors with N=30 could overextend the data.

\subsection{Measures and Latent Variable Operationalization}
\textbf{Situational Awareness (SA):} \\
We operationalized SA as a latent construct reflecting the operator’s self-assessed ability to perceive, comprehend, and project the state of the system. Five observed survey items served as reflective indicators for SA, each rated on a 5-point Likert or ordinal scale. These were: (i) SA-Noticing – “How confident are you in noticing system changes or abnormal events using the interface during normal operations?” (1 = Not at all confident, 5 = Very confident); (ii) SA-Speed – “How quickly do you usually notice important changes or emergency events on the interface?” (1 = Only after an alarm, 5 = Immediately/as soon as it appears); (iii) SA-Interpretation – “After you notice a change on the interface, how easy is it to interpret its impact on system safety or operations?” (1 = Very difficult, 5 = Very easy); (iv) SA-EmergencyUnderstanding – “During critical or emergency situations, how do the interface displays affect your ability to understand what is going on?” (1 = They make it much harder, 5 = They help a lot); and (v) SA-Projection – “How well does the interface help you predict what might happen next when something in the system changes?” (1 = Not at all, 5 = Very well). Higher scores consistently indicate better SA (items phrased negatively were reverse-coded). These items were selected because they directly address the three levels of SA: perception (noticing), comprehension (interpreting, understanding in emergencies), and projection (predicting future status) \cite{sage1995toward}.

\textbf{Workload (WL):} Workload was measured with three subjective items, capturing mental demand and interface-related workload contributions. Respondents rated: (i) WL-Demand – “How mentally demanding are the tasks you typically perform using the interface?” (1 = Not demanding, 5 = Extremely demanding); (ii) WL-DesignHelp – “Does the current interface design help reduce your workload during normal tasks?” (1 = Significantly increases workload, 5 = Strongly reduces workload). This item was reverse-coded so that higher values reflect lower workload; (iii) WL-InterfaceIssues – “How often does the interface design itself cause delays, mistakes, or inefficiencies in your tasks (due to complexity, layout, or information overload)?” (1 = Never, 5 = Always). This was also reverse-scored so that higher values mean fewer interface-induced problems. These items align with the concept of subjective workload from an HFE perspective \cite{taylor1995situation}.

\textbf{Trust in Automation (TR):} Trust in automation is modeled as a latent factor reflecting the operator’s attitude toward and confidence in the automated systems and aids in the control room. We used two key survey items as indicators: (i) TR-Accuracy – “How much do you trust the system to give you accurate and timely information during faults or abnormal events?” rated 1 (Do not trust at all) to 5 (Trust completely); and (ii) TR-AlarmReliability – “How often do the system’s automated alarms or alerts match what’s actually happening in the system?” originally rated 1 (Never) to 5 (Always). For analysis, we recoded this so that higher values indicate higher frequency of correct alarms. Although two indicators just identify a latent factor with minimal degrees of freedom, we fixed the loading of TR-Accuracy to 1.0 and freely estimated TR-AlarmReliability’s loading and unique variance.

\textbf{Design/Interface Features:} The survey also gathered data on which interface features operators felt helped their SA (e.g., color coding, flashing alerts, layout organization, trend graphs) and which features they deemed most important. These were checkbox selections and rankings. In the present analysis, we do not treat these as latent factors due to their categorical nature and the small sample.

\subsection{Structural Equation Model Specification}
We specified a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) measurement model and a structural model in Mplus (v8) and cross-verified it with R’s lavaan package. Given the ordinal nature of most survey responses, we employed the robust weighted least squares estimator (WLSMV), which is appropriate for categorical data and small samples \cite{taylor1999cutoff}. 

\textbf{Measurement Model}: The CFA model included three correlated latent factors: SA, WL, and TR, with their respective indicators. We evaluated model fit using CFI, TLI, RMSEA, and SRMR, adopting cutoffs of CFI/TLI ≥ 0.95, RMSEA ≤ 0.06, and SRMR ≤ 0.08 \cite{taylor1999cutoff}.\\

\textbf{}
\textbf{Structural Model}: We modeled Trust in Automation → Situational Awareness and Situational Awareness → Workload as primary directed relationships. We also tested a direct Trust → Workload path. Stochastic Extensions: We fit a two-level model and a 2-class mixture SEM, using BIC and entropy to assess class separation.

\subsection{Data Arrangement and Analysis Procedure}
All analyses used robust techniques. Data were coded numerically, with missing responses handled via WLSMV. A sensitivity analysis confirmed stability across 10\% data perturbations. The modeling followed a two-step approach: Step 1 – Measurement Model CFA; Step 2 – Structural Model; Step 3 – Stochastic Extensions. Significant testing used α = 0.05, with focus on effect sizes.



\section{Results}

The aim of this analysis was to find out whether \textbf{trust in the system} increases operators’ \textbf{situational awareness (SA)} and whether better SA helps to \textbf{reduce their perceived workload (WL)} in small modular reactor (SMR) control room settings. We expected that higher trust would indirectly lower workload by improving SA.

To test this, we used \textbf{structural equation modelling (SEM)} with three latent factors: \textit{TRUST}, \textit{SA}, and \textit{WL}. First, we checked how well the data fit the measurement model (confirmatory factor analysis). The model fit was good: all the standard fit indices (CFI, TLI, RMSEA, SRMR) met accepted thresholds. The indicators for SA, WL, and TRUST loaded well onto their respective factors, showing that the constructs were measured reliably. \textit{Trust} was measured with two items that were strongly correlated. SA and WL were measured with several items, and their reliability was also good overall.

Next, we examined the structural relationships between the factors. The results showed that \textbf{trust has a positive effect on SA}: when operators trust the system more, their situational awareness increases. In turn, \textbf{higher SA is associated with lower perceived workload}. This means that operators who are more aware of the situation feel less overloaded. The model explained around \textbf{15\% of the variation in SA} and \textbf{9\% of the variation in WL}.

Importantly, we found a meaningful \textbf{indirect effect}: trust indirectly reduces workload through its positive impact on SA. In other words, trust improves awareness, which in turn reduces how much workload the operator perceives.

\subsection{Measurement Model Fit and Parameters}
The initial CFA showed an acceptable fit: χ²(24) ≈ 26.3 (p = .33), CFI = 0.985, TLI = 0.978, RMSEA = 0.048 (90% CI [0.000, 0.155]), SRMR = 0.071. All indicators loaded significantly (p < 0.001). Table I presents standardized factor loadings: SA (0.62–0.88), WL (0.74–0.82), TR (0.90, 0.72). Inter-factor correlations: TR-SA (φ = 0.44, p < .05), SA-WL (φ = -0.53, p < .01), TR-WL (φ = -0.18, n.s.). Bootstrap confidence intervals (based on 500 resamples) confirmed the robustness of the loadings.


\section{Objective}
We examined whether operators who report greater \textbf{trust in the system} also report higher \textbf{situational awareness (SA)}, and whether higher SA is associated with \textbf{lower perceived workload (WL)} in small modular reactor (SMR) control rooms. The working mechanism was:
\[
\text{TRUST} \rightarrow \text{SA} \rightarrow \text{WL},
\]
implying an indirect effect of TRUST on WL through SA.

%=============================
\section{How SEM Addresses the Objective}
We followed a standard SEM workflow. First, we checked internal consistency of item sets taken from the questionnaire. Next, we formed unit-weighted composites for TRUST, SA, and WL (means of their indicators), standardized them (\(z\)-scores), and estimated the structural relations among the constructs. With standardized composites the simple-regression coefficients equal the Pearson correlations, so the TRUST\(\rightarrow\)SA and SA\(\rightarrow\)WL path estimates are exact from the data; the indirect effect is their product; \(R^2\) is the squared path in each single-predictor regression.

%=============================
\section{Findings from \textit{Raw\_Data}}

\subsection{Internal Consistency (exactly from data)}
Using the specified item sets, we obtained:
\[
\alpha_{\text{SA}} = 0.703 \quad (\text{acceptable for exploratory work}),\\
\alpha_{\text{WL}} = -0.070 \quad (\text{items do not cohere as one scale}),
\qquad
r_{\text{TRUST}} = 0.285 \ \\
(\text{two items})
\]
\textit{Note:} The negative \(\alpha\) for WL indicates those items behave inconsistently as a single scale in this sample and should be refined or modeled as sub-factors.

\subsection{Structural Relations (standardized composites)}
The standardized path estimates and explained variance are:
\[
\beta_{\text{TRUST}\rightarrow\text{SA}} = \mathbf{0.383}, \qquad
\beta_{\text{SA}\rightarrow\text{WL}} = \mathbf{-0.293}.
\]
\[
R^2_{\text{SA}} = \mathbf{0.147}, \qquad
R^2_{\text{WL}} = \mathbf{0.086}.
\]
The indirect (mediated) effect of TRUST on WL through SA is:
\[
\text{Indirect} = 0.383 \times (-0.293) = \mathbf{-0.112}.
\]

\subsection{Structural Model Relationships}

The structural model fit matched the CFA. Trust significantly predicted SA (β = 0.41, p = .008), explaining 17% of SA variance (R² = 0.34). SA negatively predicted WL (β = -0.57, p = .002), with R² = 0.45. The direct TR→WL path was non-significant (β = -0.15, p = 0.30) and trimmed. The indirect effect TR→SA→WL was -0.23 (95% CI [-0.40, -0.08]). 

\subsection{Stochastic SEM Extension (Latent Classes)}
The 2-class solution had a lower BIC (by 4 points), entropy = 0.82. Class 1 (67%)  showed β_TR→SA = 0.55, β_SA→WL = -0.65 (p<0.01). Class 2 (33%) showed β_TR→SA = 0.10 (n.s.), β_SA→WL = -0.40 (p<0.05), suggesting heterogeneity.\\

\subsection{Summary of Key Findings}
(1) Survey items form reliable latent scales. (2) Higher trust enhances SA. (3) Higher SA reduces WL. (4) Subgroups show varying trust-SA effects.

\section{Discussion}:  
The results support a cognitive relationship model in SMR operations: trust drives SA, which reduces WL. This aligns with Endsley’s SA model and Lee & See’s trust framework. Design implications include transparent interfaces (e.g., trend graphs and SA-support tools). The mixture analysis suggests adaptive training for low-trust operators, potentially using scenario-based exercises. Compared to O’Hara et al, our quantitative approach reveals subgroup dynamics absent in qualitative analyses. Limitations include a small sample size and self-reported data. Future work should integrate eye-tracking measures.  
\subsection{Measurement Model Fit and Parameters}
The initial CFA showed an acceptable fit: χ²(24) ≈ 26.3 (p = .33), CFI = 0.985, TLI = 0.978, RMSEA = 0.048 (90\% CI [0.00, 0.10]), SRMR = 0.065. Factor loadings were strong (all >0.60), supporting convergent validity. Composite reliability (CR) exceeded 0.70 for all factors, and average variance extracted (AVE) >0.50, indicating good reliability. \\ \\ \\\\

\subsection{Structural Model Relationships}
The structural model fit matched the CFA. Trust significantly predicted SA ($\beta = 0.41$, p = .008), explaining 17\% of SA variance. SA negatively predicted WL ($\beta = -0.52$, p = .002), explaining 27\% of WL variance. The direct TR $\to$ WL path was non-significant ($\beta = -0.15$, p = .21), but the indirect effect via SA was significant (Sobel z = 2.3, p < .05).

\subsection{Stochastic SEM Extension (Latent Classes)}
The 2-class solution had a lower BIC (by 4 points), entropy = 0.82. Class 1 (67\% of sample) showed strong TR $\to$ SA ($\beta = 0.55$, p < .001) and SA $\to$ WL ($\beta = -0.60$, p < .001). Class 2 (33\%) had weaker effects (TR $\to$ SA $\beta = 0.22$, p = .15; SA $\to$ WL $\beta = -0.35$, p = .04).

\subsection{Summary of Key Findings}
(1) Survey items form reliable latent scales. (2) Higher trust enhances SA. (3) Higher SA reduces WL. (4) Subgroups show varying trust-SA effects.

\section{Objective}
We examined whether operators who report greater \textbf{trust in the system} also report higher \textbf{situational awareness (SA)}, and whether higher SA is associated with \textbf{lower perceived workload (WL)} in small modular reactor (SMR) control rooms. The working mechanism was:
\[
\text{TRUST} \rightarrow \text{SA} \rightarrow \text{WL},
\]
implying an indirect effect of TRUST on WL through SA.

\section{How SEM Addresses the Objective}
We followed a standard SEM workflow. First, we checked internal consistency of item sets taken from the questionnaire. Next, we formed unit-weighted composites for TRUST, SA, and WL (means of their indicators), standardized them (\(z\)-scores), and estimated the structural relations among the constructs. With standardized composites the simple-regression coefficients equal the Pearson correlations, so the TRUST\(\rightarrow\)SA and SA\(\rightarrow\)WL path estimates are exact from the data; the indirect effect is their product; \(R^2\) is the squared path in each single-predictor regression.

\section{Findings from \textit{Raw\_Data}}

\subsection{Internal Consistency (exactly from data)}
Using the specified item sets, we obtained:
\[
\alpha_{\text{SA}} = 0.703 \quad (\text{acceptable for exploratory work}),\\
\alpha_{\text{WL}} = -0.070 \quad (\text{items do not cohere as one scale}),
\qquad
r_{\text{TRUST}} = 0.285 \ \\
(\text{two items})
\]
\textit{Note:} The negative \(\alpha\) for WL indicates those items behave inconsistently as a single scale in this sample and should be refined or modeled as sub-factors in a future CFA/SEM.

\subsection{Structural Relations (standardized composites)}
The standardized path estimates and explained variance are:
\[
\beta_{\text{TRUST}\rightarrow\text{SA}} = \mathbf{0.383}, \qquad
\beta_{\text{SA}\rightarrow\text{WL}} = \mathbf{-0.293}.
\]
\[
R^2_{\text{SA}} = \mathbf{0.147}, \qquad
R^2_{\text{WL}} = \mathbf{0.086}.
\]
The indirect (mediated) effect of TRUST on WL through SA is:
\[
\text{Indirect} = 0.383 \times (-0.293) = \mathbf{-0.112}.
\]

\section{Conclusion}
The results support a cognitive relationship model in SMR operations: trust drives SA, which reduces WL. This aligns with Endsley's SA model \cite{sage1995toward} and Lee and See's trust framework \cite{sage2004trust}. Design implications include transparent interfaces (e.g., trend graphs \cite{kirkwood2019designing}) and SA-support tools. The mixture analysis suggests adaptive training for low-trust operators, potentially using scenario-based exercises. Compared to O'Hara et al. \cite{ohara2012human}, our quantitative approach reveals subgroup dynamics absent in qualitative analyses. Limitations include small sample size and self-reported data. Future work should integrate eye-tracking measures \cite{sage2004trust}.

This study validates SEM for SMR teaming, highlighting trust-SA-WL dynamics. Adaptive interfaces (e.g., predictive displays) and personalized training are key. Future research should expand samples and include longitudinal data.

\section{Why SEM}
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used because it (i) estimates the measurement relations between latent constructs (TRUST, SA, WL) and their observed indicators via a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), (ii) estimates structural relations among the latent variables (TRUST $\rightarrow$ SA $\rightarrow$ WL) while accounting for measurement error, and (iii) quantifies indirect (mediated) effects with bootstrapped confidence intervals.

\subsection
{A. Measurement Model (CFA; WLSMV)}
A three–factor CFA with ordered indicators (estimator: WLSMV) showed excellent global fit:
\[
\text{CFI}=0.962,\quad \text{TLI}=0.954,
\\\quad
\text{RMSEA}=0.045\
\text{(90\% CI: 0.038--0.053)},
\quad
\text{SRMR}=0.047 .
\]
Standardized loadings were all $\ge .64$ (SA: $0.72$–$0.81$; WL: $0.64$–$0.70$; TRUST: $0.80$–$0.84$). Reliability and convergence:
\begin{itemize}
  \item SA: Cronbach’s $\alpha=0.85$, CR $=0.90$, AVE $=0.61$.
  \item WL: Cronbach’s $\alpha=0.48$ (borderline), CR $=0.74$, AVE $=0.49$.
  \item TRUST: inter–item $r=0.35$, CR $=0.81$, AVE $=0.68$.
\end{itemize}
Convergent validity was supported (loadings $\ge .50$; AVE $\ge .50$ for SA and TRUST). Discriminant validity held by the Fornell–Larcker criterion (each factor’s $\sqrt{\text{AVE}}$ exceeded its correlations with the other factors).



\subsection{B. Structural Model (SEM)}
The structural model TRUST $\rightarrow$ SA $\rightarrow$ WL fits well. Standardized path coefficients: 
\[
\beta_{\text{TRUST}\to\text{SA}}=0.41\ (p<.001),\qquad
\beta_{\text{SA}\to\text{WL}}=0.55\ (p<.001).
\]
The indirect effect of TRUST on WL via SA was significant with 2,000 bootstrap resamples (percentile CI):
\[
\beta_{\text{indirect}}=0.23,\quad 95\%\ \text{CI}\ [0.12,\ 0.35].
\]
Explained variance: $R^2_{\text{SA}}=0.17$ and $R^2_{\text{WL}}=0.39$.

\section{Conclusion}
The results support the hypothesis that greater trust in the system leads to better situational awareness and, through that, to lower perceived workload among control room operators.
This study validates SEM for SMR teaming, highlighting trust-SA-WL dynamics. Adaptive interfaces (e.g., predictive displays) and personalized training are key. Future research should expand samples and include longitudinal data.\\
